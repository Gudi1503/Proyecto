	<h1>CONSUMERISM 

A CURRENT SLAVERY </h1>

<p>Consumerism, a current slavery that affects the whole world since it constantly appears in different means of advertising. Consumerism has always been present as there are always new product launches either improving them or innovating and encourages you to continue consuming or purchasing the products. </p> 

<p>Companies use different techniques such as using music, characters, eye-catching colors or different types and sizes of lyrics, and their products are based on fashions whether it's a lifestyle or products such as clothing, automobiles, accessories, electronics, personal hygiene products, cleaning products or products for the current situation such as water covers, masks or disinfectants. </p> 

<p>We analyzed an ad about natural juices that help people's well-being and health, the predominant colors of the ad are green, black and white orange, but mostly predominantly green, which is consistent with what respondents said. The slogan he presents to us is "If you're on a diet and you don't have time WE PREPARE IT FOR YOU!" </p>

<p>In a survey that we applied to 20 people, including family and friends, we realized that most people see ads through social media and what they look at most about an ad is the content, also the price and the people/characters that appear. What draws people's attention to ads is usually colors because they are what stands out most about an ad according to what they explain, for example, they told us that in a commercial of a naturist product the color that most catches their attention is green and in some cases yellow. Another thing that also catches their attention from an ad is the phrase used to convince the consumer or recipient to purchase the product, also known as "slogan," this phrase is often short and easy to remember from which the recipient or consumer is expected to be trusted.  </p>

<p>If unnecessary consumerism continues to increase, GHG emissions will increase over time. What is GHG? GHG is an atmospheric gas that absorbs and emits radiation within the range of the planet. This process is the root cause of the greenhouse effect. The main GHGs in the terrestrial atmosphere are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. </p> 

<p>In our opinion consumerism is good if we do it in a conscious way, that is, buy what you really need or what you are really going to use, because otherwise we would be increasing pollution and causing companies to continue producing new products and increasing the pollution of the planet.  </p>

<p>Within the analysis exposed, consumerism has many points of view which we must take into  para     account so that there is a balance between what we needandwhat we donot need,so that the pollution of the planet reduces and we live in a better way. </p>
